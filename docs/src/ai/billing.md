# Billing

We use Stripe as our billing and payments provider. All Pro plans require payment via credit card. For invoice based billing, a Business plan is required. Contact sales@zed.dev for more details.

## Settings {#settings}

You can access billing settings at /account. Clicking [button] will navigate you to Stripe’s secure portal, where you can update all billing-related settings and configuration.

## Billing Cycles {#billing-cycles}

Zed is billed on a monthly basis based on the date you initially subscribe. We’ll also bill for additional prompts used beyond your plan’s prompt limit, if usage exceeds $20 before month end. See [usage-based pricing](./plans-and-usage.md#ubp) for more.

## Invoice History {#invoice-history}

You can access your invoice history by navigating to /account and clicking [button]. From Stripe’s secure portal, you can download all current and historical invoices.

## Updating Billing Information {#updating-billing-info}

You can update your payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal. We use Stripe as our payment processor to ensure secure transactions. Please note that changes to billing information will **only** affect future invoices - **we cannot modify historical invoices**.

## Cancellation and Refunds {#cancel-refund}

You can cancel your subscription directly through the billing portal using the “Cancel subscription” button. Your access will continue until the end of your current billing period.

You can self-serve a refund by going to the billing portal and clicking on the Cancel subscription button. Our self-serve refund policy is as follows:

**EU, UK or Turkey customers**

Eligible for a refund if you cancel your subscription within 14 days of purchase.

**All other customers (US + rest of world)**

Refundable within 24 hours after purchase.

If you’re not in the window of self-serve refunds, reach out at billing-support@zed.dev and we’ll be happy to assist you.
