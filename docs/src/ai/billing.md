# Billing

We use Stripe as our billing and payments provider.
All Pro plans require payment via credit card.
For invoice based billing, a Business plan is required.
Contact sales@zed.dev for more details.

## Settings {#settings}

You can access billing settings at [zed.dev/account](zed.dev/account).
Clicking [button] will navigate you to Stripe’s secure portal, where you can update all billing-related settings and configuration.

## Billing Cycles {#billing-cycles}

Zed is billed on a monthly basis based on the date you initially subscribe.
We’ll also bill for additional prompts used beyond your plan’s prompt limit, if usage exceeds $20 before month end.
See [usage-based pricing](./plans-and-usage.md#ubp) for more.

## Invoice History {#invoice-history}

You can access your invoice history by navigating to [zed.dev/account](zed.dev/account) and clicking [button].
From Stripe’s secure portal, you can download all current and historical invoices.

## Updating Billing Information {#updating-billing-info}

You can update your payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal.
We use Stripe as our payment processor to ensure secure transactions.
Please note that changes to billing information will **only** affect future invoices—**we cannot modify historical invoices**.
