Add 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet' as a new model to our application's model dropdown list.

Here's what I need:
1. Add 'Claude 3.7 Sonnet' to the model list in all relevant files
2. Include any necessary implementation details (model ID, API parameter values, etc.)
3. Make sure to update any interface definitions, constants, or type declarations
4. Update any relevant tests or documentation

Please make the following assumptions:
- Model ID should be "claude-3-7-sonnet-20240307"
- The model should be positioned in the hierarchy between Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus
- The app likely has model selection in multiple components (UI dropdown, API handlers, constants files)
- There may be model-specific parameters or configurations to set
