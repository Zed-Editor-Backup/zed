1. The changes add new imports (`Element`, `ElementId`, `GlobalElementId`, `Hitbox`, `IntoElement`, `LayoutId`, `Position`, `Style`) to the gpui use statement and import several new modules from the crate including hierarchy, transform components, layout properties, and spatial systems.
2. The `Luna` struct now includes a new `canvas` field of type `Entity<Canvas>`, which is initialized in the `new` method. The render method now includes this canvas as a child element. This appears to be part of setting up a new canvas-based rendering system.
3. A new `Canvas` struct and its implementation are added, which manages and renders UI elements using the ECS system. The canvas includes functionality for:
   - Managing viewport size
   - Adding elements with default transforms and layout properties
   - Handling layout and painting of entities
   - Performing hit testing
   - Maintaining a hierarchy of elements
   - Computing and applying world transforms for rendering
4. The canvas implementation includes three main trait implementations:
   - `Element` with custom layout, prepaint and paint logic
   - `IntoElement` for conversion
   - `Focusable` for input handling
   The paint method renders entities with their transforms and includes logic for proper z-ordering.
5. The diff shows the canvas maintains spatial data through a `HitTestSystem` and `QuadTree`, handles entity transforms through a `LocalTransform`/`WorldTransform` system, and manages layout through `LayoutProperties` with size constraints and margins. The rendering shows basic colored quads for entities when no specific render component exists.
