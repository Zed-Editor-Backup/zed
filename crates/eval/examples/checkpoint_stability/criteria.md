1. A new changeset file is created to document three bug fixes. The fixes address an issue with duplicate checkpoints, a problem where hovering over a checkpoint without moving the mouse would make the popover disappear, and a bug where browser tool actions were not being grouped properly due to checkpoint interruptions.
2. In `task/index.ts`, modifications prevent duplicate checkpoints by checking if the last message was `"checkpoint_created"` before creating a new one. Additionally, the automatic checkpoint saving after browser actions has been removed by commenting out `await this.saveCheckpoint()`, ensuring browser actions remain grouped without unnecessary checkpoints.
3. The `ChatView.tsx` file updates the logic for detecting browser session messages. A note clarifies that any messages intended to be part of a browser session should be explicitly included. The `"checkpoint_created"` message type is now included in the list of messages that count as part of a browser session, fixing an issue where checkpoints inserted after browser actions disrupted session grouping.
4. In `CheckmarkControl.tsx`, hover behavior is improved with a new `handleIndicatorMouseLeave` function that better manages mouse leave events. Both the indicator and `HoverArea` components now use this updated handler, resolving the issue where popovers would disappear if the mouse remained stationary over a checkpoint. The expanded UI section remains unchanged but is prepared for additional hover-related refinements.
