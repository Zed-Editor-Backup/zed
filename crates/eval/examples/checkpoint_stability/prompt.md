We've been experiencing some friction in our checkpoint system that's affecting both functionality and UX. First, there's an issue where duplicate checkpoint messages are being generated unnecessarily - could you modify the logic to prevent a new checkpoint if the last message was already a 'checkpoint_created' event? This seems to be causing some downstream problems.

Additionally, we've noticed that browser tool actions are being unintentionally split up by these automatic checkpoints, which breaks the continuity of browser sessions. The system should treat checkpoints as part of the browser session group rather than interruptions. This might involve both removing the automatic checkpoint after browser actions and ensuring the message grouping logic recognizes checkpoints as valid session messages.

Finally, there's a UX issue where the checkpoint hover popover disappears if the user stops moving their mouse while hovering. The current mouse leave detection seems too aggressive - could we refine this to only dismiss the popover when the cursor actually leaves the checkpoint area, not just when it becomes stationary? This should involve updating both the indicator and hover area components with more precise mouse event handling.
