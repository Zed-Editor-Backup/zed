I need to improve our logout feature. When users sign out, they should be able to specify a return URL to redirect to afterward. Right now, signing out just takes them to a default page, but we want to support custom redirects (like back to the homepage or a login screen). The URL should be safely included in the logout request. Make sure existing logouts still work normally when no redirect is specified.
