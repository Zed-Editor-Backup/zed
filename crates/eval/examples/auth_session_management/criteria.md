1. Add a new test case in `create-client.test.ts` for when the `returnTo` option is provided during sign-out. It verifies that the sign-out URL includes the correct `return_to` query parameter with the provided URL. The test sets up a mock client, calls signOut with a returnTo value, and asserts that the resulting URL contains the expected session_id and return_to parameters while maintaining the correct API endpoint structure.
2. Modifies the `signOut` method in `create-client.ts` to accept an optional options parameter containing a returnTo string. Instead of directly passing the sessionId to getLogoutUrl, it now passes an object containing both the sessionId and the returnTo value from the options. The method maintains its existing behavior of checking for an access token and clearing session data when a URL is available.
3. Updates the HTTP client tests in `http-client.test.ts` to reflect the new getLogoutUrl signature. It adds a test case for the basic logout URL and a new describe block for when returnTo is provided, verifying that the URL includes the properly encoded return_to parameter. The test ensures the URL construction handles both cases correctly.
4. Modifies the `getLogoutUrl` method in `http-client.ts` to accept an object parameter with sessionId and returnTo properties instead of just a sessionId string. It maintains the base URL construction but now conditionally adds the return_to query parameter only when a returnTo value is provided, while always including the session_id parameter. The method handles URL construction and parameter encoding internally.
