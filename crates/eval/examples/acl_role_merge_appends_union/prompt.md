We need to update the ACL system to modify how "appends" parameters are merged when combining multiple roles. Currently, the system uses an "AND" merge strategy, which unintentionally filters out appended values if one of the roles has an empty appends array. Instead, we should adopt a "UNION" approach to ensure all specified appends are preserved.

In the ACL system, when a user has multiple roles, their permissions are merged. The current implementation handles "appends" parameters with andMerge logic, which is incorrect for this use case. For example, if one role defines appends: ['a', 'b'] and another has appends: [], the merged result should retain ['a', 'b']â€”not discard them. This behavior is particularly important for maintaining data consistency when roles are combined.
