1. A new test case is added to verify the behavior of merging appends parameters when one role has appends ['a', 'b'] and another has empty appends []. The test expects the result to contain both 'a' and 'b' in the appends array.
2. The implementation change modifies the merge behavior for appends parameters from using `andMerge` (which would intersect the arrays) to using 'union' (which combines all elements from both arrays). This change ensures that appends from different roles are combined rather than intersected.
3. The test case demonstrates the expected behavior where combining roles with appends ['a', 'b'] and empty appends [] results in a union containing ['a', 'b'], which matches the new 'union' strategy implemented in the utility function.
