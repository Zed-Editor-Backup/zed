Improve the tool response handling in our Google message formatter to make it more robust and maintainable. Currently, the logic for empty tool responses is overly complex. We need to simplify this while ensuring the behavior remains correct. When a tool response has empty content, the system should automatically use 'Tool call is done.' as the default message. The formatted output must maintain exactly the same JSON structure we currently use for tool responses. Also add comprehensive test coverage that verifies this default message behavior works correctly, including a test case with completely empty tool response content. The changes should make the code easier to understand while keeping all existing functionality working exactly as before.
