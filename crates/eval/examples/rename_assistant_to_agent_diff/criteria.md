1. The changes rename all instances of "assistant" to "agent" in keybindings, context names, command handlers, and file references. This includes updating JSON keymap contexts from `assistant_diff` to `agent_diff`, renaming commands like `OpenAssistantDiff` to `OpenAgentDiff`, and updating Rust module/file names from `assistant_diff.rs` to `agent_diff.rs`.
2. The `AssistantDiff` struct and related components are renamed to `AgentDiff`, including its toolbar (`AssistantDiffToolbar` becomes `AgentDiffToolbar`). All associated event handlers, method calls, and UI references are updated to use the new "agent" naming convention throughout the codebase.
