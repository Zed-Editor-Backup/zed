        Look at the `{FILENAME}`. I want to implement a card for it. The card should implement the `Render` trait.

        The card should show a diff. It should be a beautifully presented diff. The card "box" should look like what we show for
        markdown codeblocks (look at `MarkdownElement`). I want to see a red background for lines that were deleted and a green
        background for lines that were added. We should have a div per diff line.
