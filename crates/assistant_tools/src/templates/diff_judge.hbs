You are an expert coder, and have been tasked with looking at two diffs and determining how close they are to achieving the same goal.

<diff_a>
{{diff_a}}
</diff_a>

<diff_b>
{{diff_b}}
</diff_b>

## Output

You must respond with a score between 0 and 100, where 100 means the diffs are identical and 0 means they are completely different, using the following format:

<score>your_score_here</score>
